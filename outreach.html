    <h1 class="display-4">Outreach</h1>

    <p>As someone who values connecting with peers, disseminating scientific information to the community, and enjoys helping others, I have consistently done my best to continue doing all of these things in ways that are both safe and appropriate. I have tried to understand others' diverse perspectives, even if I disagree with them personally.</p>
    
    <h2>Open Science and Science Communication</h2>

    <p>Open science includes sharing papers, methods, data, and code, as well as communicating findings to fellow scientists at conferences or via social media and clearly communicating information with non-scientists. In order to reach my peers, I use the <a href="https://osf.io/hqxfd/">Open Science Framework</a> for preregistration of data and to add information about methods as well as <a href="https://github.com/PsychNStuff">GitHub</a> on which I share open source code. I use <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceisWhere">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhallpsych">LinkedIn</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://genomic.social/@ScienceisWhere">Mastodon</a>, as ways to network with others more informally. I have also had the opportunity to attend conferences, often due to the fact that they were available online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, however, I have begun attending conferences in-person.</p>

    <h2>Community Service and Volunteering</h2>

    <p>Serving the community at-large is an incredible way to help others, and research has shown that this has psychological benefits. In the past, I have volunteered with a virtual texting helpline called <a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups of Tea</a>. During the pandemic, this allowed me to help others from the relative safety of my home. As hospitals began accepting new volunteers, I connected with and began volunteering at a large trauma hospital near me called <a href="https://www.honorhealth.com/">HonorHealth</a> in March, 2022. Since then, I have been volunteering once a week at the hospital by answering questions, providing direction, and doing necessary tasks such as restocking masks. My most recent endeavor has been at a nonprofit called <a href="https://prescientist.org/">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a> focused on making scientists seem human to youth in middle school. I have been matched with a pre-scientist who is my penpal, and am excited to write letters back and forth with this student for the 2022-2023 school year!</p>
    
    <h2>Leadership and Advocacy</h2>

    <p>Throughout high school and my undergraduate training, I sought leadership positions. I was part of the Next Generation Service Corps, was the Director of Community Outreach for <a href="https://psychology.asu.edu/student-life/the-undergraduate-experience/psichi">Psi Chi</a> at Arizona State University, and was a member of multiple boards and committees. However, it is now my personal belief that leadership comes from listening and learning, and leading by example.
      Although I do not currently hold any leadership positions as I have graduated, I am lucky to be a member of the <a href="https://www.apa.org/">American Psychological Association</a> and <a href="https://www.psichi.org/">Psi Chi, the International Honors Society in Psychology</a>.</p>
