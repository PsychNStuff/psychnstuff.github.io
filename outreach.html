          <h1 class="display-4">Outreach</h1>

          <p>As someone who values connecting with peers, disseminating scientific information to the community, and enjoys helping others, outreach is very important to me.</p>
    
          <h2>Open Science and Science Communication</h2>

          <p>Open science includes sharing papers, methods, data, and code, as well as communicating findings to fellow scientists at conferences or via social media and clearly communicating information with non-scientists. In order to reach my peers, I have used the <a href="https://osf.io/hqxfd/">Open Science Framework</a> for preregistration of data and to add information about methods as well as <a href="https://github.com/PsychNStuff">GitHub</a> on which I share open source code. I use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhallpsych">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ScienceisWhere">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://neuromatch.social/@ScienceisWhere">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scienceiswhere.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, to network with others more informally. I'm also a volunteer on the Website Team (formerly the Chief Website Manager) at <a href="https://knowingneurons.com/">Knowing Neurons</a>, whose goal is to further communicate neuroscience to a wider audience. With them, I have written a <a href="https://knowingneurons.com/blog/2024/09/24/meg-neurosurgery/">blog post on magnetoencephalography</a> and discussed my work in a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7891taUFGIU7YjGOd2iMgN?si=134f35b128bd4d4f">podcast</a>.

    <h2>Community Service</h2>

    <p>Serving the community at-large is an incredible way to help others, and research has shown that this has psychological benefits. I enjoy volunteering with <a href="https://prescientist.org/">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a> in order to learn how to communicate about science with youth and help younger people feel engaged in science. I also volunteer with <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">the Trevor Project</a>, a crisis line designed to aid LGBTQ+ youth. I have previously volunteered with <a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups of Tea</a> and <a href="https://www.honorhealth.com/">HonorHealth</a>.
