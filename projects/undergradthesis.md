This project is based in psychology and included preregistration on the [Open Science Forum](https://osf.io/r68aj/) where methods and data are stored and can be requested. The project helped me learn basic scientific writing skills, the process of IRB submissions and online data collection, and a vast amount of research methodology.

We found that, when viewing nature photos versus their own social media feeds, 182 participants recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk only experienced a statistically significant difference in one out of ten scales when conducting an ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test. Full results can be read as a preprint on [PsyArxiv](https://psyarxiv.com/bfpq6/). Statistical analysis used IBM SPSS 25; R version 3.4.1 was used to make barplots. Reproducible code is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/PsychNStuff/BriefExpNatSM).

In this project I was able to design, implement, write, and present a study in its entirety.
