At the [DICoN Lab](https://www.instituteforhumanneuroscience.org/dicon-lab), I work with [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](https://knowingneurons.com/blog/2024/09/24/meg-neurosurgery/), T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessments of learning, memory, processing speed, language, and executive function. My most recent publication from the DICoN Lab is on working memory in young healthy adults, and I am currently working with task-based MEG data (specifically, a semantic judgement task) in adults ages 21-87. Next, I'm excited to start working on a project utilizing neuroimaging data and neuropsychological assessment in healthy adults and those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI).

In addition to analysing data and writing papers, I have had the opportunity to adminsiter full neuropsychological assessments, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for research purposes in healthy adults, those diagnosed with AD/MCI, those diagnosed with HIV, and substance users (specifically cannabis and methamphetamine).
