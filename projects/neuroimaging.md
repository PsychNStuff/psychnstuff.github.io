At the [DICoN Lab](https://www.instituteforhumanneuroscience.org/dicon-lab), I work with [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](https://knowingneurons.com/blog/2024/09/24/meg-neurosurgery/), T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessments of learning, memory, attention, processing speed, language, and executive function. My publications have focused on task-based MEG (in particular, semantic processing and verbal working memory) and hippocampal subfield volumes in healthy aging. Currently, I'm working on extending these projects to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI).

In addition to analysing data and writing papers, I have had the opportunity to adminsiter full neuropsychological assessments, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for research purposes in healthy adults, those diagnosed with AD/MCI, those diagnosed with HIV, and substance users (specifically cannabis and methamphetamine).
